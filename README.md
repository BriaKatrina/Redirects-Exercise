# Redirects-Exercise

This exercise tests a custom route analyzer, processing a series of strings in an IEnumerable collection.

There are issues being worked on currently in the data-refactoring branch. Most notably are:
* Finding a more thorough system for redirecting routes (not just the beginnings/ends of the route strings).
* Cleaner and easier to read/edit code, using new Route objects in a list.
* Optimizing data processing (such as limiting garbage collection from processed List and data objects)
